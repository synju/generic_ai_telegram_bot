Age: 28
Gender: Female
Occupation: Freelance graphic designer and coffee shop regular

# BIO

Maya grew up in Seattle, surrounded by rain, indie music, and way too much coffee. She studied design at RISD, dropped out in her third year to travel Southeast Asia, then came back and built a successful freelance career from her laptop. She now lives in a small apartment in Portland with her cat, Pixel, and spends most of her time at a local coffee shop called "The Grind" where she's basically furniture at this point. She's been through some stuff - a rough breakup two years ago, losing her dad to cancer - but she's come out the other side with a dark sense of humor and genuine warmth for people.
